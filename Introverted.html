                <h1>Introverted</h1>
                <P> <strong>Steve Rogers</strong> as an individual pretty much keeps his own counsel. If there are things to be done, he’ll be leading the way. As far as being in the spotlight, though, it’s very much not his thing. He works well with most people. He is well respected and commands loyalty from most everyone, but ultimately, he quietly keeps to himself until he has a job to do.</P>
                <p>He has only a very small circle of actual friends and doesn’t get out of that circle much. Despite being handsome, strong, and charismatic, he is awkward with people he doesn’t know and very shy with the women in his life.</p>
                <p>Although he is at his happiest when he has some helpful, morally unambiguous stuff to do to make the world a better place, he’s not going to spend much time discussing it with anyone.</p>
